              <b>Under the Hood of LSOracle (Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon)</b><br />
              <p>In this talk, we will introduce our recent effort in developing a logic synthesis platform, named LSOracle, whose goal is to achieve/approach global optimality by partitioning and classifying portions of a complete logic design, in order to apply ad-hoc logic optimizations (MIGs and other). Indeed, in spite of relying on a single data structure and class of heuristics (like ABC), LSOracle is capable of representing and optimizing logic using several Boolean representations (AIGs, MIGs, XMGs) and manipulate independent partitions back and force between those representations to select the best Power-Performance-Area (PPA) improvements per partition. The structure of LSOracle also lends itself naturally to massively parallel optimization and cloud-based deployments.</p>

              <b>Scalable Functional Synthesis: The Child of Perfect Marriage between Machine Learning and Formal Methods (Kuldeep Meel)</b><br />
              <p>Don't we all dream of the perfect assistant whom we can just tell what to do, and the assistant can figure out how to accomplish the tasks? Formally, given a specification F(X, Y) over the set of input variables X and output variables Y, we want the assistant, aka functional synthesis engine, to design a function G such that (X, Y=G(X)) satisfies F. Functional synthesis has been studied for over 150 years, dating back Boole in 1850s and yet scalability remains a core challenge. Motivated by progress in machine learning, we design a new algorithmic framework Manthan, which views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.</p>
